In the early 60s, keyboard proficiency was less widespread, so other input methods were explored.

^ You know, before their time, really, because they had these massive CRT screens etc., no iPad.

Instead of implementing an entire interface paradigm, only consider *core problem*: Recognition of a single-stroke character.

[Slight modifications to some characters to make this work.]()

## The RAND tablet was $18000, which is slightly above my pay grade

Simple D3.js-based web version, connected
to a PostgreSQL instance running on my
server. Try it on your phones:

## `hejnoah.com/handwriting/`

---

The web version yields a *JSON array of coordinate pairs*. In order to transfer this into a ![inline](pglogo.png) database...

**1.** Define variable `pen` via command-line parameter.

```bash
psql -v pen='[{"x":1, "y":2},{"x":2, "y":4}]' -f handwriting.sqlÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
```

**2.** Convert JSON array into tabular representation.

<!--
```sql, [.highlight: 4]
-->

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE  -- test
tablet(pos, x, y) AS (
  SELECT ordinality AS pos, x, y
  FROM   ROWS FROM(jsonb_to_recordset(:'pen') AS (x int, y int))Â WITH ORDINALITY
), ...
```

---

## Approach[^1]

1. Smoothing & thinning of pen stroke
2. Curvature & corner detection
3. Extraction of other features (start, end, aspect ratio, ...)
4. Descending a hardcoded decision tree[^2] successively mapping features to characters

[^2]: Neural nets and deep learning weren't feasible back then~~, and neither were blockchains and ICOs~~.

---

**Smoothing:** Removes *quantization noise*. Compute weighted average of most recently smoothed point and incoming point.

# TODO video

---

Variable `smoothingfactor` must be set before running the query. Sensible values: between 0.5 and 0.8.

```sql
smooth(pos, x, y) AS (
  SELECT pos, x :: real, y :: real
  FROM   tablet
  WHERE  pos = 1

    UNION ALL

  SELECT t.pos,
         (:smoothingfactor * s.x + (1.0 - :smoothingfactor) * t.x) :: real AS x,
         (:smoothingfactor * s.y + (1.0 - :smoothingfactor) * t.y) :: real AS y
  FROM   smooth s, tablet t
  WHERE  t.pos = s.pos + 1
),
```

---

**Thinning:** Eases further *processing requirements*. Reject points within a certain distance from the most recent accepted point.

# TODO video

---

```sql
thin(pos, x, y) AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM   smooth
  WHERE  pos = 1

    UNION ALL

  SELECT *
  FROM   (
    SELECT s.pos, s.x, s.y
    FROM   thin t, smooth s
    WHERE  s.pos > t.pos
    AND    :thinningsize < |/ (s.x - t.x)^2 + (s.y - t.y)^2Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
    ORDER BY s.pos
    LIMIT 1
  ) AS _
),
```

---

**Curvature detection:** Compute *cardinal directions* â–²â–¼â—€â–¶ of line segments between point pairs. Discard sequential duplicates.

Orignially done using set of inequalities, but on modern hardware some trigonometry does a much better job.

![original](2018-05-23 18.01.35.jpg)

---

**1.** Compute angle between every pair of thinned points using window function `lag()`:

```sql
curve(pos, x, y, direction) AS (
  SELECT pos, x, y,
         COALESCE(degrees(-atan2( y - lag(y) OVER (ORDER BY pos),Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
                                 -x + lag(x) OVER (ORDER BY pos))
                         ) + 180,
                  90)
  FROM   thin
),
```

---

**2.** Define fancy `ENUM` type with even fancier unicode arrows:

```sql
CREATE TYPE cardinal_direction AS ENUM('â–¶', 'â–²', 'â—€', 'â–¼');Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
```

**3.** Use `enum_range()` function (returns all values of its argument's `ENUM` type in an array) to convert `angle / 90` into arrow symbols.

```sql
cardinal(pos, direction) AS (
  SELECT pos,
         (enum_range(NULL :: cardinal_direction))[(direction / 90) :: int + 1]Â Â 
  FROM   curve
),
```

---

**4.** Only keep changes of the cardinal direction, i.e. a new direction that occurs at least twice in succession.

```sql
cardinal_change(pos, direction) AS (
  SELECT pos, direction
  FROM   (SELECT pos, direction,
                 COALESCE(lag(direction, 2) OVER win <> lag(direction) OVER win,
                          true)  -- Prevent NULLs from escaping this term.
                 AND lag(direction) OVER win = direction
          FROM cardinal
          WINDOW win AS (ORDER BY pos)) AS _(pos, direction, is_new)
  WHERE  is_new
),
```

Awkward because window functions are illegal in `WHERE` clauses.

---

**Corner detection:** Allows discerning between *similar characters* (U/V, 5/S). Corners lie between two segments going in the same direction and two segments going in a wildly different direction, with an optional in between "turn" segment.

# TODO drawing/video, maybe four examples U V 5 S in essay style

---

```sql
corner(pos, x, y, corner) AS (
  SELECT pos, x, y
  FROM   (SELECT pos, x, y, (
                   lag(direction) OVER win = lag(direction, 2) OVER win
                   AND lead(direction) OVER win = lead(direction, 2) OVER win
                   AND abs(lag(direction) OVER win - lead(direction) OVER win)
                       > :cornerangle / 16
                 ) OR (  -- One-segment turn OR immediate direction change.
                   direction = lag(direction) OVER win
                   AND lead(direction) OVER win = lead(direction, 2) OVER win
                   AND abs(direction - lead(direction) OVER win)
                       > :cornerangle / 16
                 ) AS is_corner
          FROM   (SELECT pos, x, y, (direction / 22.5) :: int AS direction
                  FROM curve) AS _
          WINDOW win AS (ORDER BY pos)) AS _(pos, x, y, is_corner)
  WHERE  is_corner
),
```

---

**Feature extraction:** Extract some *other features* (in addition to cardinal directions and corners) that will help discern between different characters later on: Start point, end point, aspect ratio, ...

Transform from absolute pixel positions to 4x4 grid segments.

---

**1.** Define *axis-aligned bounding box* around pen stroke and gather some statistics.

```sql
aabb(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, aspect, width, height, centerx, centery) AS (
  SELECT min(x),
         max(x),
         min(y),
         max(y),
         (max(y) - min(y)) / greatest(1, (max(x) - min(x))),  -- Prevent n/0.Â Â Â 
         max(x) - min(x),
         max(y) - min(y),
         min(x) + (max(x) - min(x)) / 2,
         min(y) + (max(y) - min(y)) / 2
  FROM   smooth
),
```

---

**2.** Transform positions of start and end points into grid segments, as well as corners.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION gridpos(width real, height real,
                                   xmin real, ymin real,
                                   x real, y real) RETURNS int AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN greatest(0,
                  15 - (      (floor(4 * (x-xmin)/(width + 1)) :: int)
                        + 4 * (floor(4 * (y-ymin)/(height + 1)) :: int)));Â Â Â Â Â Â 
END
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

---

```sql
start_grid(n) AS (
  SELECT gridpos(a.width, a.height, a.xmin, a.ymin, s.x, s.y)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
  FROM   smooth s, aabb a
  ORDER BY pos
  LIMIT 1
),
stop_grid(n) AS (
  SELECT gridpos(a.width, a.height, a.xmin, a.ymin, s.x, s.y)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
  FROM   smooth s, aabb a
  ORDER BY pos DESC
  LIMIT 1
),
corner_grid(pos, n) AS (
  SELECT c.pos, gridpos(a.width, a.height, a.xmin, a.ymin, c.x, c.y)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
  FROM   corner c, aabb a
),
```

---

**3.** Collect extracted features. This single-row table contains all information required to identify the drawn character.

```sql
features(center, start, stop, directions, corners, width, height, aspect) AS (Â Â 
  SELECT point(centerx, centery),
         (TABLE start_grid),
         (TABLE stop_grid),
         (SELECT array_agg(c.direction ORDER BY c.pos)
          FROM   cardinal_change c),
         (SELECT array_agg(c.n ORDER BY c.pos)
          FROM   corner_grid c),
         a.width,
         a.height,
         a.aspect
  FROM   aabb a
),
```

![left](decisiontree.png)

**Decision tree:** Depending on the first four cardinal directions, descend custom-tailored subtrees until a choice can be confidently made.

Incredibly *awkward* in SQL:
Imagine 500+ lines of deeply nested and probably buggy `CASE WHEN`s.

---

A better approach is to do this in *two discrete stages*:

1. Determine potential characters based on the pen stroke's *first four cardinal directions*.
2. Consult *lookup table*: mapping from set of characters to best fit based on features.

This is less flexible than the procedure presented in the memorandum/essay, but significantly more idiomatic and thus concise.

---

**1.** Determine initial set of potential characters.

```sql
CREATE TABLE lookup1 (
  first_four_directions cardinal_direction[],Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
  potential_characters  char[]
);
INSERT INTO lookup1 VALUES
  ('{"â–¼"}',             '{"I"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â—€"}',         '{"J"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â—€","â–²"}',     '{"O","J","X","U"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â—€","â–²","â–¶"}', '{"X","O","U"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â—€","â–¶","â–²"}', '{"X"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â–¶"}',         '{"L"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â–¶","â—€"}',     '{"6"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â–¶","â—€","â–¼"}', '{"4"}'),
  ('{"â–¼","â–¶","â–²"}',     '{"O","U"}'),
  ...
```

---

**2.** Find best fit by matching extracted features. Read `NULL` values as "don't care".

```sql
CREATE TABLE lookup2 (
  potential_characters char[],
  character            char,
  start                int,
  stop                 int,
  corners              int[],
  last_direction       cardinal_direction,
  aspect_range         numrange
);
INSERT INTO lookup2  -- All single-character patterns from initial lookup table.
  ...
INSERT INTO lookup2 VALUES
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'O', 0, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'O', 1, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'O', 2, 2, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'O', 3, 3, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'J', NULL, 11, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'J', NULL, 15, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"O","J","X","U"}', 'X', 3, 0, '{12,15}', NULL, NULL),
  ...
  ('{"M","N"}', 'M', NULL, 12, NULL, NULL, NULL),
  ('{"M","N"}', 'N', NULL, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL);
```

---

**3.** Tie them together. TODO update probably

```sql
potential_characters(characters) AS (
  SELECT potential_characters
  FROM   features, lookup1
  WHERE  directions[1:4] = first_four_directions
),
character(character) AS (
  SELECT character
  FROM   features f, potential_characters p, lookup2 l
  WHERE  p.characters = l.potential_characters
  AND    COALESCE(f.start = l.start, true)
  AND    COALESCE(f.stop = l.stop, true)
  AND    COALESCE(f.corners = l.corners, true)
  AND    COALESCE(l.aspect_range @> f.aspect :: numeric, true)
),
```

## Analysis

It's fast enough. Probably mostly $$O(n)$$.
